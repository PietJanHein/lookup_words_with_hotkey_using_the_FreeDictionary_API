# lookup_words_with_hotkey_using_the_FreeDictionary_API

With this little script you can look up the definition of a word from your terminal. The intended usage is that you make a hotkey to open the script in your favorite terminal, usually the flag for it is -e. I also added to it that it stores the output in a file in the same directory, you can easily remove that part if you don't like it.
